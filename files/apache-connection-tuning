# StartServers: initial number of server processes to start
# MinSpareServers: minimum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# MaxSpareServers: maximum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# MaxClients: maximum number of simultaneous client connections (MaxClients should always be <= ServerLimit)
# ServerLimit:is only used if you need to set MaxClients higher than 256 (default). Do not set the value of this
# directive any higher than what you might want to set MaxClients to.
# MaxRequestsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves
# if you are unable to determine this information the standard 1000 should be used.
